## No such table: main.auth_user__old

There's something wrong with the Dell laptop which snow's school gave her.

The Data base is malfunctioned, the error said there is no such a table main.auth_user__old. 

I checked it by google, and found some answer which suggested me to change a db or to degrade the  db. And I chose the first option.

There was a video guide me to use postgreSQL, and I followed it but went strayed, I downloaded some advanced version so I can't handle it, again I watched another video which taught me how to install the postgreSQL, I followed it and thank god everything went well this time.

After makemigrations and migrate, the database was written, and I could successfully add data through web browser.



I reference the link of articles which helped me to solve problem  as follow:
